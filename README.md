# Object Recognition in Images (Supervised Learning: Classification)

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create an objection recoginition classification algorithm using Convulutional Neural Networks (CNN). 
The CNN Will be trained using a sample train dataset and subsquently tested on real images to evaluate performance.

Through creating the trained CNN, the team aims to obtain a better understanding of CNNs and the various steps required for creating a machine learning project, including the following steps:

1. Data Preperation
2. Data Processing
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation and testing.

## Imports

To implement this machine learning model, the following libraries were used:

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
tensorflow
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

## Results

Model Accuracy: 85.36% on Test Set
